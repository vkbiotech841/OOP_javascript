// Inheritance: In OOPs, Inheritance enables an object or class to take on properties, methods of another object or class. This make a piece of code to re-used at multiple places.
// In this way; we can re-use the properties and methods into the another object or class.
// Inheritance is two types:
// (1) Protypical Inheritance: in Javascript
// (2) Classical Inheritance: in Typescript

// In javascript we do not have the any concept of class. Hence, Inheritance of Objects in javascript is called as prototypical Inheritance. whereas inheritance of class or objects in typescript is called as Classical Inheritance.

//  Let say, Parent Class/object has method that need to be inherited to child class A and Child class B. So, Parent class is called as "Base/Super/Parent" class/object. Whereas child class A and B are referred as "Derived/Sub/Child" class/object. This type of inheritance relationship is called as "IS-A" (read as is-a)relationship.
